# Electron, TypeScript, Material-UI, React Boilerplate

Modern and lightweight boilerplate built with electron, typescript, react, webpack, and material-ui. This also demonstrates live-reloading and static images.

## Major technologies

- [React.js 17](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Electron 12](https://www.electronjs.org/)
- [Material-UI 5](https://next.material-ui.com/)
- [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/)
- Typescript, ESLint, and Prettier are used to improve the developer experience

## Getting Started

1. Download this repo or run the following command to clone it

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hellosoftware-io/electron-typescript-react-material-ui myapp
```

2. Using NPM 7, run the following command to install dependencies

```sh
cd myapp
npm install
```

3. Run the following command to build and start the development version of your app with live reloading.

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Packaging

Run `npm run package` to build and package your electron app.

## Common issues

### xcrun: error: invalid active developer path

This is caused when elecron-builder tries to sign a build. Run `xcode-select --install` to install the necessary Xcode tools.
